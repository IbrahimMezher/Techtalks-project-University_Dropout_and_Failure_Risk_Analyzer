# University Dropout and Failure Risk Analyzer project
Many students leave university due to financial pressure, workload shock, or academic difficulty. This
project analyzes anonymized student data such as attendance, grades, and course difficulty to identify
early risk indicators. The goal is prevention and support, not surveillance.
